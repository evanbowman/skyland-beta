// NOTE: for GBA, the arm compiler drags in junk code from newlib. And I really
// mean junk. No offense to the people who wrote the newlib libc implementation,
// but it's really not a good fit for a lot of embedded systems. The functions
// below aren't particularly optimized for gba, but speed isn't my gripe with
// newlib. The library does all sorts of stuff for reentrancy, which isn't
// applicable to the gba console and dumps several kilobytes of junk into
// iwram. Whenever I see a function from libc in the game's linker map file, I
// replace the implementation of the function with my own version, to protect my
// code against newlib's stupid decisions. But the culprit isn't just newlib!
// It's easy enough for me not to include C headers and not use the C standard
// library. libstdc++ keeps invoking stuff from libc, which dumps junk that I
// didn't want into iwram. What can I do though? I'm just a lowly hobby
// programmer, subject to the whims of the clueless people in charge of
// maintaining this toolchain.
