extern bool _cursor_moved;

// Repaint required, but only because the cursor toggled between light and
// dark. Even more heavily optimized than cursor movement. Redoing the
// depth-test each time that the cursor idly flickers would burn battery for no
// particular purpose. While we don't want to keep the entire depth buffer in
// memory, we keep a cache of the rendering stack expressly for redrawing the
// flickering cursor without needing to redo the depth test.

// (e.g. camera movement, effects).

// to only redraw a subset of the map, the game lags significantly. Added after
// a month of work on the engine, improved cursor scrolling speed
// significantly. I did previous optimizations to only redraw changed blocks,
// but storing a persistent global variable in this way allowed me to also skip
// large parts of the depth testing, in addition to the redraw.
//
// NOTE: IMPORTANT: The engine will get confused and drop tiles if a block is
// created and destroyed within the same frame. Not relevant in most cases, but
