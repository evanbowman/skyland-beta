Every island starts with one resident. Each day, your islands will gain and lose residents based on available food and housing! Build more housing to encourage villagers to settle!
Each of your villagers produces ten productivity points per day! Spend productivity to build structures, plant or harvest crops, and more!
Each villager consumes one unit of food per day. Be sure to plant some crops; your residents will start to leave if there's nothing to eat!
Each island can store five units of food. Build granaries to increase your food storage limit!
Crops take a few days to ripen. Check them regularly! If you leave ripe crops unharvested, they'll go bad! Press the left shoulder button + A to check for ripe crops!
Crops won't grow in the dark. But you can build light sources, allowing you to layer crops vertically!
Wheat: 2 days, yield 3, Potatoes: 6 days, yield 15, Lumber: 10 days, yields wood
When you have a large enough population, you can settle other nearby islands! See the macrocosm menu for options.

Water source block.

"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"
Flows across an island, sets non-fireproof blocks aflame.

While ineffective against most modern weaponry, villagers in skyland still build structures with stone, because it looks nice. Click to change style.
A shiny metal statue. Click to change style.

A structure designed to bridge a large vertical distance by dividing it into smaller vertical distances, often called steps.

May be salvaged for one hundred percent of its value! Useful for co-op multiplayer.
Weaker than regular missiles, but with a wider damage radius, and starts fires. Manufactory required.
Changes the weather!
Automatically chooses weapon targets for you! You might be able to do a better job yourself, but oh, how convenient! (and you can still pin targets manually)

A powerful weapon that only works in the stormiest weather. Gains one ammo and charges one level per lightning strike.
Text written in some strange language... what could it mean? (If you see one, click to enlarge)
Conceal blocks! AI player cannot see blocks created fully within a cloak. AI will guess cloaked blocks based on behavior. Takes ion damage.
This block used to control the crew AI, but is no longer needed.
...
An old weapon from the surface world below, no one knows how to build them anymore... starts raging fires... if you're lucky, maybe you'll find one...
Built long ago on the surface, this laser burns through everything in its path, dealing damage to each block that its beam touches.
Built thousands of years ago during the surface wars. Extremely durable and repairable, with huge power output. No one makes engines like this anymore.
Mostly decorative, but generates some power. Power output doubled in stormy weather. One allowed per island.
Built on the surface, these missiles divide into ten projeciles upon impact and ricochet off walls. Few, if any, still exist, look in shops...
Like a ladder, but one block taller. (Upgrade a ladder via the SELECT menu)
Like a stairwell, but one block taller.
Like a stairwell+1, but one block taller.
A small single-person vessel. Often used by villagers to make long trips between islands; it doesn't use much fuel.
A barbaric weapon from long ago. Creates a huge explosion, spreading damage and fire over a large area. A well placed shot can easily demolish half of a castle. Single use.
...
What could this be? You'll have to try it out in the sandbox level editor and see what it does... (max % allowed per level).
Originally designed to shield against harsh radiation on the surface. Emits a weak energy field, but with a wide area. All nearby blocks will take % damage less.
Allows crewmembers to travel instantly to any other portal on your island! More resource-hungry than a stairwell, but allows you to design very compact castles!

terrain size?
Error! Island has too many blocks to compress into a legible QR code! Sorry, this is a technical limitation, not much can be done, other than reducing the number of blocks in your island.
WARNING: Your island is pretty big, and the resulting QR code does not fit onscreen except when using 1-pixel-per-block. We highly recommended that you reduce the number of blocks on your island, as you may have trouble scanning the QR code (hint: if you are using Android, you may need to scan with Google lens).
The Nintendo DS does not have a Gameboy Advance Link Port, sorry!
Connect two GBA consoles by plugging the 1p end of a link cable into the first device, and the 2p end of the link cable into the second device. When both devices display the following white screen, press START to connect.
