 For anyone who wants to
 translate the game. Skyland
 natively supports Unicode,
 and ships with all of the
 glyphs required for English,
 Spanish, French, German,
 Italian, Russian, Ukrainian,
 Japanese, and a subset of
 2500 of the most common
 Chinese words.

 To localize the game, choose
 one of the two following
 methods:

 1) Single language ROM (easier)
 Translate all of the strings
 in the game's scripts
 (the files in the strings/
 directory and the scripts/
 directory). Then follow the
 instructions in readme.txt
 for zipping everything up and
 building a game ROM. You
 should be able to do all of
 this without any help.

 Steps:
 a) Use unpack_rom.py
    to unpack files from
    Skyland.gba

 b) Translate the text
    as described above.

 c) Run repack.sh
    to zip everything back
    up.

 d) Test the translated
    ROM to make sure that
    it works.

 The above steps should just
 require an installation of
 python3.


 2) Multi-language ROM (harder)
 I need to make some
 organizational changes to
 support multilingual ROMs
 properly. Follow step 1 and
 get a translated ROM working,
