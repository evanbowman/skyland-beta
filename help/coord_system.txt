 Describes the coordinate
 system used by SKYLAND's
 engine.

 SKYLAND uses an inverted
 coordinate system
 consisting of sixteen rows,
 such that row fifteen
 includes an island's
 terrain. e.g.:

 X: terrain

 ... 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...
 11:
 12:
 13:
 14:
 15: X  X  X  X  X  X

 Now, let's suppose that a
 script places a power-core,
 a 2x2 room, at coordinate
 (1, 13). Now, our grid
 looks like this:

 X: terrain
 R: room

 ... 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...
 11:
 12:
 13:    R  R
 14:    R  R
 15: X  X  X  X  X  X

 Makes sense?
 Long story short, the
 game places terrain in the
 highest numbered row of
 the map grid. X indices
 increase from left to
 right, and y indices
 increase from top to
 bottom.

 One final note: In addition
 to manually defining a room
 layout in the script editor, 
 you may also use the
 Battle Sandbox. I mainly
 designed the game's levels
 in the sandbox mode, and used
 the UART shell to dump level
 data. You could also use the
 sandbox's saving feature,
 and copy the file data out
 of the .sav file if you're
 using an emulator. However,
 the game compresses save
 data, and if you want to
 copy stuff out of the save
 file, hold down the select
 button while saving a
 sandbox, which disables
 compression.
