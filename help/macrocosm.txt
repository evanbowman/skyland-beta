 I'm writing down some info
 about the SKYLAND macrocosm
 here, until I manage to create
 in-game help menus.

 Macro mode implements a
 psuedo-macroeconomics-inspired
 city-building game.

 Most things should be self-
 explanatory. But I'd like to
 comment on a few
 non-obvious things:

 1) Population: both food
 supply and available housing
 influence population growth.
 With insufficient food, the
 population will shrink.

 2) Specialization: It's
 cheaper to build a crop or
 livestock next to an existing
 tile of the same type,
 encouraging you to specialize
 in producing certain
 commodities.

 3) Scarcity and diminishing
 returns: Each additional
 commodity of the same type
 added to a local economy
 produces diminished
 coin yields. Use ports to
 export excess of a commodity
 to other islands, where
 the item is more scarce.

 4) Light: Some crops and 
 commodity tiles will produce 
 reduced output, or no output,
 when not provided light.
