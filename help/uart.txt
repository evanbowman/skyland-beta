
 SKYLAND UART Console info

 In addition to providing an
 onscreen lisp repl when
 calling the repl function,
 SKYLAND offers a repl via
 uart.

 Using the uart terminal
 requires some familiarity
 with soldering. But fear
 not, there's no need to open
 up your gba! you just need
 to splice a link cable into
 an rs232 cable.

 Before proceeding, make
 absolutely certain that your
 rs232 adapter operates at
 3.3 volts, the voltage of
 the gameboy link port.

 First, you'll want to cut
 the end off of a cheap
 aftermarket link cable.
 As you do this, take careful
 note of which colored wires
 correspond to which pins
 in the above diagram of the
 cable plug.

 Aside: Please don't ruin an
 original gba link cable from
 back in the day, it's
 sort of a historical
 artifact at this point, and
 expensive besides.

 Next, you'll need to solder
 the gba link cable's SO
 line into the rs232 cable's
 RxD line.
 
 Solder the link cable's SI
 line into the rs232 cable's
 TxD line.

 You do not need to connect
 the flow control lines.

 I typically use picocom
 in linux to connect to
 SKYLAND.

 To launch picocom, figure
 out which file linux mapped
 your serial cable to, and
 run the picocom program,
 like so (on my computer,
 the file is called
 /dev/ttyUSB0):

 picocom /dev/ttyUSB0

 SKYLAND uses a transmission
 frequency of 9600 baud,
 which at time of writing,
 is the default in picocom.

 Ok, you should be all set
 up! Enable developer mode,
 Restart skyland, and
 the game should print
 a command prompt into
 picocom.

 If you're unfamiliar with
 picocom or linux, you may
 instead use Putty in Windows,
 or serial-term in emacs.

 All of the functions in
 /help/api.txt are of course
 available in the console!
