 images.txt

 Not all images in the project
 are possible to easily modify
 with the modding toolchain.
 But the game does allow you
 to draw custom cover images
 for level events. The
 img_enc.lua script in the
 tools directory converts
 image data to the format
 expected by the engine when
 loading image files.
 For organizational purposes,
 you may put your images in
 /scripts/data/img/, and by
 searching /scripts/data/img/
 in the scripts direction, you
 will see how I've attached
 images to the existing level
 scenarios. I did not include
 tools for unpacking .skg
 images, sorry. But as the game
 is open source, you can get
 them from the project's main
 repository.
