;;; The game invokes this script when creating a save file. The result of this
;;; script will be stored in save memory, and passed to restore_save.lisp when
;;; reloading a game. As you see below, the list itself is an association list,
;;; and you may insert new key-value pairs if you have any data in particular
;;; that you'd like to save.
