To create image files:

Either use the grit utility with the following commands:
grit <file> -ftb -gzl -gB4 -pe16

Or use the img_enc.lua script provided in the tools directory.

Grit will produce smaller images, because it supports compression.  But I can't
ship the grit program with the rom because it's too big, so if you don't have
access to grit, try the lua script.
