FROM THE ARCHIVES OF THE

ASHWALKER ORDER,

THIRD CYCLE OF THE ASHEN MOON:


We who walk the sssurface

remember the one who made usss

what we are - the Ssserpent

Doctor, who first massstered the

change that the sssurface

bringsss.


In those ancient daysss, when

the world first turned

poisonousss and humansss fled to

the skiesss, he remained below

in his great citadel, ssstudying

the transssformative powersss of

the sssurface world.


He wasss brilliant and cruel,

performing experimentsss on

thossse who could not flee in

time.


Through his workssss, the

changesss that normally took

generationsss were accelerated,

shaped, controlled.

Sssome he twisssted into sssavage

raidersss, others he refined

into creatures of higher

thought. Our own ancestorsss,

the first Ashwalkersss, were

among his final experimentsss

before his disssappearance -

given the ability to withssstand

the surface'sss poisonsss while

maintaining our mindsss.


The location of his fortresss

hasss been lossst to time, though

our ssscouts sssay there isss a

place in the deepessst stormsss

where even the most desssperate

ssscavengers will not go.

The ssstorms there are...

different. Wrong.


Sssome say he ssstill livesss,

having somehow dissscovered a

way to prolong his life.

Others claim his experimentsss

continue even now, his

influence felt in the ssstorms

that drive our people ever

higher into the sssky.


But thessse are merely talesss we

tell our young.

After all, what being could

live ssso long, or command the

very air itself?

Ssstill... when the ssstorms grow

ssstrange and colored lightsss

dance in the toxic cloudsss,

sssome of us remember the old

texts that ssspoke of his final

goal - to force all of

humanity to face the sssame

choice our ancestorsss did:

transssform or perish.


...final entry:

The ssstorms grow more frequent

now, more purposeful.

In my darkessst momentsss, I

wonder if perhapsss thisss being

in the ssstorm is the same...
