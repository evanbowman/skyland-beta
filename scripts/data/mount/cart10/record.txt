FROM THE ARCHIVES OF THE

ASHWALKER ORDER,

THIRD CYCLE OF THE ASHEN MOON:


We who walk the surface

remember the one who made us

what we are - the Serpent

Doctor, who first mastered the

change that the surface

brings.


In those ancient days, when

the world first turned

poisonous and humans fled to

the skies, he remained below

in his great citadel, studying

the transformative powers of

the surface world.


He was brilliant and cruel,

performing experiments on

those who could not flee in

time.


Through his works, the

changesss that normally took

generations were accelerated,

shaped, controlled.

Some he twisssted into savage

raiders, others he refined

into creatures of higher

thought. Our own ancestors,

the first Ashwalkers, were

among his final experiments

before his disappearance -

given the ability to withstand

the surface's poisons while

maintaining our minds.


The location of his fortress

has been lost to time, though

our scouts say there is a

place in the deepest storms

where even the most desperate

scavengers will not go.

The storms there are...

different. Wrong.


Some say he still lives,

having somehow discovered a

way to prolong his life.

Others claim his experiments

continue even now, his

influence felt in the storms

that drive our people ever

higher into the sky.


But these are merely tales we

tell our young.

After all, what being could

live so long, or command the

very air itself?

Still... when the storms grow

strange and colored lights

dance in the toxic clouds,

some of us remember the old

texts that spoke of his final

goal - to force all of

humanity to face the same

choice our ancestors did:

transform or perish.


...final entry:

The storms grow more frequent

now, more purposeful.

In my darkest moments, I

wonder if perhaps this being

in the storm is the same...
