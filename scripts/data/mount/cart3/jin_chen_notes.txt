RESEARCH NOTES: PROJECT BACKUP

By Jin Chen, Core Engineer


Year 12 Post-Migration

Need to record this while it's

fresh. We did it. After six

failed prototypes, number

seven worked.

Key was scaling everything

down - not just the power

output, but the containment

system too. Previous attempts

tried to match old core

specs. Wrong approach.

Test island stayed aloft for

72 hours on the small core.

Barely enough lift for

essentials, but it works.

Could've saved Fall Harbor if

we'd figured this out sooner.


CRITICAL SPECS:

1/4 standard chamber size

Minimal crystal lattice

Simplified cooling

Low-yield fuel mix


Won't replace a main core,

but buys time for replacement

or evacuation. Calling it the

standby-core. Sending designs

to other engineers tomorrow.

Never want to see another

island fall because they

couldn't replace a dying

core.
