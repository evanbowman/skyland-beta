# Castaway
[character_1]

regression_test = "Working!"
welcomes_traveller = "<c:Castaway:1>Another transporter refugee! I ended up the same way... though I'm still not sure if jumping blindly into one was brave or just lucky..."

# Other Castaway
[character_27]
welcomes_girl = "<c:Castaway:27>Your village showed more spine than my old crew. They threw me overboard rather than face the raiders. At least here, we stick together!"
welcomes_explorer = "<c:Castaway:27>Mapping the skies? Good. The more we know about what's out there, the better we can fight back. Good to have you aboard!"

# Girl from burning island
[character_14]
welcomes_castaway_1 = "<c:Girl:14>Another survivor! I know how it feels... the crew here helped me after I lost my village. You're in good hands!"
welcomes_castaway_2 = "<c:Girl:14>Another survivor! I know how it feels... the crew here helped me after I lost my village. You're in good hands!"
welcomes_warrior_princess = "<c:Girl:14>(Aside: The warrior princess is so cool! <B:0> Someday I want to be like her...)"

# Explorer
[character_22]
welcomes_warrior_princess = "<c:Explorer:22>A royal mission to secure ancient weapons? I've never even charted this location before, how exciting!"
