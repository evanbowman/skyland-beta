;;; Anvil Annie is a highly paranoid hermit. I thought about making different
;;; dialog when playing as goblins, but you know what, I think I'll keep it. Even
;;; crazy consipracy theorists are right sometimes. A broken clock is right twice
;;; a day, so they say. It also means her character works on multiple levels:
;;; Surface level: Crazy hermit with trust issues.
;;; Meta level: Commentary on how truth and madness can coexist.
;;; It lets the context completely reframe the character without changing a
;;; word. When playing as goblins, when meeting this character for the first
;;; time, one might think, she's a hardened realist. Then later when running into
;;; this character as humans -- no wait, she's entirely crazy.
